# Stack-part 1: Binary classification of matches

Using the candidate matches created in the previous stage, we ensemble three models: GBDT (XGBoost, lightGBM), BERT(xlm-roberta-base).
For this id-pair (e.g., src_id, dst_id), GBDT mainly used the edit distance feature, while BERT used text created in particular columns. These models classified whether the pair matched or not.


## GBDT

### Features

XGBoost features were created by colum2131 ( @columbia2131 ), and lightGBM features by ria ( @no9more9ria10 ).
Although there are some differences in each feature, the following XGBoost’s features were below:

* Features generated independently with src_id and dst_id
   * latitude / longitude
   * country with ordinal-encoding
   * categories with ordinal-encoding
* Features generated dependently with src_id and dst_id
    * Edit distance (name, categories, address, city, state, zip, url, phone)
        * gesh
        * leven
        * jaro
        * simple_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * partial_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * token_set_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * token_sort_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * token_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * partial_token_ratio (RapidFuzz)
        * wratio (RapidFuzz)
        * qratio (RapidFuzz)
    * Set similarity with .split(“ ” or “, “) (name, cateogires)
        * jaccard
        * dice
        * sympson
    * Cosine similarity of vectors encoded by tf-idf (name, categories, address, all)
        * tfidf(ngram_range=(1, 1), analyzer=‘word’)
        * tfidf(ngram_range=(1, 3), analyzer=‘char’)
* Others
    * probability by transformer


#### Modeling

The cross-validation of the train data was purposely split so that leakage would occur.
Specifically, instead of the folds with GroupKFold(n_splits=2, group=‘point_of_interest’), we created new folds with GroupKFold(n_splits=5, group=‘src_id’).
This leakage improved the CV and Public LB because train and test data contained common records.
We suspect that the latitude and longitude variables and the ordinal categories worked effectively as features to represent the common id’s records.

## BERT

### Text & Numerical-Features

The text was defined as each lowercased name and cateogires connected by a SEP-token and country.
Additionally, the numerical feature was logarithmic variables of haversine distance.

```python
def get_basearray(cfg, df):
    cfg.idx2id = df['id'].fillna('').to_numpy()
    cfg.id2idx = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(cfg.idx2id)}
    
    cfg.idx2name = df['name'].fillna('').str.lower().to_numpy()
    cfg.idx2categories = df['categories'].fillna('').str.lower().to_numpy()
    cfg.idx2address = df['address'].fillna('').str.lower().to_numpy()    
    return cfg

def get_text(cfg, i, j): # {i: index of src_id, j: index of dst_id}
    text = cfg.idx2country[i]+cfg.sep+\
            'name1 '+cfg.idx2name[i]+cfg.sep+'category1 '+cfg.idx2categories[i]+\
            cfg.sep + cfg.sep +\
            'name2 '+cfg.idx2name[j]+cfg.sep+'category2 '+cfg.idx2categories[j]
    return text
```

### Model Training

The architecture of BERT is below:

```python
class CustomModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, cfg, criterion):
        super().__init__()
        self.cfg = cfg
        self.criterion = criterion
        self.config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
            cfg.MODEL_PATH,
            output_hidden_states=True
        )
        self.config.attention_probs_dropout_prob = 0.0
        self.config.hidden_dropout_prob = 0.0
        self.backbone = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
            cfg.MODEL_PATH, # xlm-roberta-base
            config=self.config
        )
        self.linear1 = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.config.hidden_size+len(cfg.num_cols), 1024),
            nn.SELU(),
            nn.Linear(1024, 1)
        )
        
    def forward(self, inputs, labels=None):
        outputs = self.backbone(
            inputs['input_ids'],
            attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask']
        )["last_hidden_state"]
        outputs = outputs[:, 0, :]
        outputs = torch.cat((
            outputs,
            inputs['num_features']
        ), dim=1)
        logits = self.linear1(outputs).flatten()
        loss = self.criterion(logits, labels)
        return logits, loss
```

This model was trained for 5 epochs on all train data.

# Leak Post Process
As mentioned in other discussions, there was a duplication of train data in the test data.
Therefore, the some test data was merged with the train data, and matches were created with the same poi. The prediction of LB0.949 was overwritten.
We processed this matches overwriting the matches of LB0.949.
Note that train.csv is replaced on submit, so we created a separate train.csv dataset.

```python
import cudf
train = cudf.read_feather(‘../input/4sq-train-data-copy-feather/train.ftr’).fillna(‘[NAN]‘)
test = cudf.read_csv(‘../input/foursquare-location-matching/test.csv’, dtype=str).fillna(‘[NAN]’)
cols = [‘name’, ‘latitude’, ‘longitude’]
test = test.merge(train[cols+[‘point_of_interest’]], on=cols, how=‘left’)
test[[‘id’, ‘point_of_interest’]].to_pandas().to_csv(‘id2poi.csv’, index=False)

id2poi = pd.read_csv('id2poi.csv')

match_dict = {}
for poi, group_df in id2poi.groupby('point_of_interest'):
    ids = set(group_df['id'].tolist())
    for id_str in ids:
        match_dict[id_str] = ids

sub = pd.DataFrame({
    ‘id’: sub_dict.keys(),
    ‘matches’: [
        match_dict.get(key, value)
        for key, value in sub_dict.items()
    ]
})
sub[‘matches’] = sub[‘matches’].map(lambda x: ' ’.join(x))
http://sub.to_csv(‘submission.csv’, index=False)
```
