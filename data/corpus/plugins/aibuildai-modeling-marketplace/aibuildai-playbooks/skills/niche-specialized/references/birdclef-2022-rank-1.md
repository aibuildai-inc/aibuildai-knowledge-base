First of all, thanks to Kaggle Team, @stefankahl and all participants 

As you may know, in our final blend we have used BirdNet along with other models provided by me, @ivanpan, @realsleim and @selimsef

In this post I will cover my models and approach

**Model Architecture**

I was using SED architecture, proposed and used by @tattaka - [post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2021/discussion/243293)

As a backbones I have used:
- tf_efficientnet_b3_ns
- eca_nfnet_l0

I have changed the first stride from (2,2) to (1,1) in order to have larger (in terms of length and number of frequencies )  output of CNN encoder ( I have taken this trick from @ilu000 [SETI](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/seti-breakthrough-listen/discussion/266385))

**Model Training**

I have trained model on 15 sec chunks and with secondary labels

I have used following augmentations:
- GaussianNoise
- PinkNoise
- OR Mixup on waveforms
- BackgroundNoise. For training - [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50). For finetuning - esc50 + nocall from soundscapes of 2021 BirdClef Comp

Proposed by @selimsef I have used weights (computed by `primary_label`) for Dataloader and Loss in order to cope with unbalanced dataset (especially for `scored_birds`) 

As for Loss I have used simple BCE on `clipwise` logits

I was tracking 3 best checkpoints by LB metric and Validation loss and then averaged 3 model weights (kind of naive SWA)

**Training stages** 

For training I have used 2 stage training:
1. Pretrain on 2021 and 2022 comp data   
2. Finetune on data from pretrain BUT filtered by the next rule - `Take samples which contain scored_bird in primary_label OR secondary_labels`

**Inference**

Having SED model I have tried 2 options for inference:
1. Proposed by @tattaka - using AND rule for `long` and `short` clipwise predictions. short prediction - 5 sec, long - 15 sec
2. Feed model 15 sec chunk BUT apply head only on centered 5 sec reduced CNN image and use max(framewise, dim=time)

Overall second option worked better for me

Choosing threshold. Here I have tried also 2 options:
1. Use ordinary threshold. Optimal values varied for me from 0.2 - 0.3
2. Use quantile threshold, originally proposed by @philippsinger [post](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2021/discussion/243463). Optimal value for `quantile_tresh` was 0.25
```
tresh = np.quantile(
                        test_model_probs[:, scored_bird_ids].flatten(),
                        1 - quantile_tresh,
                    )
```

For solo model (5 folds) second worked better and for ensembles first worked better

**Validation**

I have used 5 CV Stratified training (also `maupar` sample was splitted on 5 samples in order to have consistent OOF score)
Compute LB metric using next prediction scheme:
For each validation sample - slice it on pieces -> predict each piece -> max(sample_predictions, dim=pieces)
And then compute metric using `all_labels=[primary_label] + secondary_labels`
Also I have computed this metric only on samples which contain scored_bird in all_labels and taking into account only scored_birds
And finally optimize threshold with step 0.1 

**Results**

- tf_efficientnet_b3_ns: Val = 0.87894692; Public = 0.82; Private = 0.78
- eca_nfnet_l0: Val = 0.88640918; Public = 0.82; Private = 0.78
